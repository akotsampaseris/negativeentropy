  <h3 class="about-section-header">Early beginnings</h3>
  <p class="about-section-text">
    I grew up in a small seaside town in rural Greece, <strong>Nea Artaki</strong>, mostly playing football in the streets and working with computers, taking them apart and putting them back together <i>(most of the time)</i>... I wasn't a big fan of school, always found that it suppressed creativity and intelligence, and rewarded conformity and homogeneity. My passion at the time was football and I wanted to become a football manager, so I entered the School of Sports Science and Physical Education in the University of Athens. During my studies in Athens, I unexpectedly fell in love with <strong>Physics and Mathematics</strong> and I decided to move to the UK and become a scientist.

  <h3 class="about-section-header">Living in England</h3>
  <p class="about-section-text">
    Life in the north of England was very difficult in the beginning, with the constant rain and the grey skies. For years I was solely focused on my work, and as a result I finished in the top place in every single year of my education. During the second year of my Bachelor's degree, I was working with <strong>Dr. James Christian and Dr. Graham McDonald</strong> on <i>Fresnel diffraction patterns from fractal apertures</i>, and I wrote a computer program that made our calculations <strong><i>400 times faster</i></strong> and accelerated the analysis of the results, which were presented in the <strong>European Optical Society Annual Meeting (EOSAM 2016)</strong> in Berlin. I continued working with Dr. Christian and Dr. McDonald and what started as my Final Project became a series of papers on <strong>Spatiotemporal Solitons</strong> that were published in the <strong>Physical Review A</strong> of the <strong>Americal Physical Society</strong>. Then I took a big chance and decided to work on Particle Physics and I started my Master's degree on <strong>Particle and Mathematical Physics</strong> in the University of Durham, where I had an opportunity to work with <strong>Prof Simon Ross</strong> on <i>the AdS/CFT Correspondence and the Holographic Entanglement Entropy in AdS Spacetimes</i>, where I received the <strong>Winton MSc Prize</strong> for the top place in the Master's.

    Soon I realised that the academic path was not the best choice for me. I came back to Greece and I started working as a <strong>Junior Developer</strong> for <strong>TechnoLogic LTD</strong>, in order to gain real-life work experience and learn how to code professionally, which was much more different from coding on your own leisure. But then I was offered an opportunity to start a <strong>PhD in Quantum Plasmonics</strong> in the <strong>University of Birmingham</strong>, and I returned to England for a few months. However, I kept on working remotely for TechnoLogic LTD, and during that time I was convinced that a career in Programming was a much better choice for me. I am now back in Greece and working to continuously evolve as a programmer and one day to become an entrepreneur.
